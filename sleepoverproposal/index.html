<p style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; color: #ffffff; max-width: 500px;"><i>The Editorial Board has been notified that the sleepover proposal that we had previously published at this page was premature and was not ready to be showcased publicly to the Hotchkiss community. As of right now, sleepovers are still under wraps, but rest assured that the student body presidents as well as various student leaders and committes are hard at work to bring sleepovers back.</p>
